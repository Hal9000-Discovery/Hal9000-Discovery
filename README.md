## 👋 Hi, I'm Dave

Senior QA / SDET with experience in:
- API automation (Postman, Newman)
- Guidewire PolicyCenter / BillingCenter / ClaimCenter
- Mock-driven testing strategies
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions & Docker
- AI-assisted test analysis (local LLMs)

🔹 Current focus: building deterministic API test frameworks enhanced with local AI for analysis (not CI gating).

🔹 “The framework is designed to support both PolicyCenter and ClaimCenter APIs using the same mock-driven, CI-friendly testing approach.”

🔹 “While the current focus is PolicyCenter, the same patterns apply to ClaimCenter and other Guidewire applications.”
